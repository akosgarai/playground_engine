# Transformations

It contains functions that represents transformations. Coordinate transformations or type specific transformations (eg float to string)

## MouseCoordinates

This function transforms the mouse coordinates to window coordinate. (windowwidth\*windowheight -> [-1, 1])

## Vec3ToString

This function transforms a 3 dimensional vector `mgl32.Vec3` to it's string representation. Useful for logs.

## Float64ToString

This function transforms a float64 type number `float64` to it's string representation. Useful for logs.

## Float32ToString

This function transforms a float32 type number `float32` to it's string representation. Useful for logs.

## IntegerToString

This function transforms an integer type number `int` to it's string representation. Useful for logs.
