# Model

The purpose of this package, to gather the mashes that are connected to the same object (eg a composite object - a lamp with pole, and bulb). The meshes of a model are moving together, they are rotating, in the same time.

## Bug model

This predefined model represents a "composite object". This model contains 4 material squere, one for the bottom, one for the body and 2 for the eyes. It has getter functions for the center point of the body parts. It's initial position, and scale are set during it's construction with the NewBug function.

## StreetLamp model

One is from plane materials, and another one that is textured. In the material version, the pole and the top is cuboid, in the textured one, they are cylinders.

## Room model
